# Day9 ( Network Management & Performing Remote Connections and File Transfers )

I like to call Linux as a network based operating system. It is very efficiently used as high performance network based system. In this module we will cover some ways of inspecting network on a Linux system & perform some remote connection transfers.

## Agenda for Day9

* Network Management

    - Controlling and Monitoring Network Interfaces
    - Checking Available and In-use network interfaces
    - Checking Running ports and services

* Performing Remote Connections and File Transfers

    - Establish a Remote login session â€“ Telnet, SSH, SFTP, etc
    - Copy files or directories to and from another system
    - Transfer files between systems
