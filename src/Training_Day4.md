# Day4 ( Working with Files and Directories )

We continued our file-system exploration journey by looking at some commands. Also most importantly the file descriptors!

File Descriptors are very important to understand, they are widely used in **Shell scripts**!

## Agenda for Day4

-  Determining Where you are in the Directory Structure
     * pwd (print name of current/working directory)
-  Viewing File Content ( Revisited )
     * cat (concatenate files and print on the standard output)
-  Copying Files and Directories
     * cp (copy files and directories)
-  Searching Files and Directories
     * find (search for files in a directory hierarchy)
     * locate (find files by name)
-  Creating and Removing Files and Directories
     * touch (change file timestamps, create blank files)
     * vi (Vi Improved, a programmer's text editor)
     * nano (Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone)
- The Standard Files
- File Descriptors ( 0, 1, 2 ) ( Revisited )
- Input Redirection
