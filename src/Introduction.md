# Introduction

Indeed during my college daysÂ **I used to hate programming**, it was difficult to understand the objective behind using programs and their purpose. Understanding how it was running on the system was another heck of a challenge. Demystifying essential components of an operating system is indeed a challenge unless you work on Linux.


*Linux has been my first love, since the day I came across it*. It helps you understand the fundamentals of the OS & it's working, which can immensely boost your productivity. Linux is also one of the most popular and most adopted Operating systems in the world right next to Microsoft Windows. 99% of the world's Super Computers are powered with Linux. Everything right from your Cellphone to Cloud-based systems runs on some form of Linux.

I had planned to take free training on Linux in which I covered following aspects of the Linux OS. This training is intended for someone who is starting his journey or someone who already has some familiarity.
